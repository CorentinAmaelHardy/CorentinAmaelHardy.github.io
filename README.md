# Good morning/afternoon/evening !
Thank you for checking my website.
## Who am I ?
I am **Corentin Hardy**, a junior Game Designer and Level Designer who is currently studying at [Rennes's ESMA school](https://www.esma-artistique.com/campus/rennes/).
  
# How do I work, exactly ?
  
Long story short : A whole lot of playtesting.
    
Ok, to be more specific, I mainly prototype and test the elements and features that I (or my teammates) made, and then playtest them so that the players can give me feedback, so that I can make new and improved iterations, as fast as possible to make the game I'm working on as fun as I can make it.
  
### What if there isn't much to show ? 
  
In that case, we have a few options.
    
- If we didn't leave the R&D stage yet, I can analyse other games to give a little push in, what I think is, the right direction (I'm not mistake-proof sadly enough...)
- If we did leave the R&D however, I can slice the game up into main features that can be divided into smaller and easy to understand tasks for the team.
# What can I use ?
I have a fair bit of experience with game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine 4 and I'm currently trying RPG Maker MV.

As for other softwares, I can use Excel, Maya and photoshop.
  
  
# My work :
  
- Worked on an unreleased school project mobile game "Propr&Net" in collaboration with the Trans-musicale festival as a game designer and 3C programmer. Propr&Net was a Beat them up where the player had to scream at people who were littering at the festival.
    
- Worked on the school project [Vorboten Reich](https://github.com/ChevalierAlexis/Verboten-Reich) as a narrative designer and game designer. It was a walking simulator, where a veterant decided to move away from his old city, who was left in ruin, to end up in a place that is much, much worse.
    
- Working on the school project "Crops Warriors" as a game designer, feature designer and level designer. You can find the [Instagram page for the project](https://www.instagram.com/cropswarriors/) here.
    
- Working on a TTRPG "The Great Lands". It's is divided in two playable eras, one is Medieval Fantasy, while the other is, even if based in the same world, in a WW1 like setting. It's main focuses are player freedom and to see how the players discover hidden lore.
