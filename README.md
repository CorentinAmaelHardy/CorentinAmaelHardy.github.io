#Good morning/afternoon/evening !
Thank you for checking my website.
## Who am I ?
I am **Corentin Hardy**, a junior Game Designer and Level Designer who studied at [Rennes's ESMA school](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/ESMA+Rennes,+%C3%A9cole+3D/@48.109497,-1.6511699,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x480edf8275e1186b:0xa5bfd84219ae6de9!8m2!3d48.109497!4d-1.648595!16s%2Fg%2F11t__vl34q?entry=ttu).

# How do I work, exactly ?

Long story short : A whole lot of playtesting.

Ok, to be more specific, I mainly prototype and test the elements and features that I (or my teammates) made, and then playtest them so that the players can give me feedback, so that I can make new and improved iterations, as fast as possible to make the game I'm working on as fun as I can make it.

### What if there isn't much to show ? 

In that case, we have a few options.

- If we didn't leave the R&D stage yet, I can analyse other games to give a little push in, what I think is, the right direction (I'm not mistake-proof sadly enough...)
- If we did leave the R&D however, I can slice the game up into main features that can be divided into smaller and easy to understand tasks for the rest of the team (if I cannot do them myself, for a lack of experience,expertise or time).


# My work :

- Worked on an unreleased school project mobile game "Propr&Net" in collaboration with the Trans-musicale festival as a game designer and 3C programmer. Propr&Net was a Beat them up where the player had to scream at people who litter.

- Working on the school project "Crops Warriors" as a game designer, feature designer and level designer. You can find the [Instagram page for the project](https://www.instagram.com/cropswarriors/) here.

- Working on a TTRPG "The Great Lands". It's is divided in two playable eras, one is Medieval Fantasy, while the other is, even if based in the same world, is in a WW1 like setting. It's main focuses are player freedom and to see how the players discover hidden lore.
